# TeamMaker
This personal project uses google sheets api to get form responses, create balanced League of Legend teams 
from the players that filled the form, and then finally output the teams back onto google sheets.

This will be helpful for next year as I will be planning round robins weekly as the Community Director
at UMich, which will save me a lot of time!
